### What I learned

Learning they say is an unending process. I was able to learn alot while completing this project. I was  able to reinforce my knowledge on REST API and how to call data from an API. I also learnt how to output multiple elements to the UI, this is one knowledge I am extremely happy with. 


```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```js
 Array.from(regionName).forEach(elem => {
            console.log(elem.innerText)
            if (elem.innerText.includes(element.innerText)) {
                elem.parentElement.parentElement.style.display = "grid"
            } else {
                elem.parentElement.parentElement.style.display = "none"
            }
        })
```

### Continued development

In future projects I will continue my development in Caliing multiple elements to the DOM (maybe work on some ecommerce websites) and also I will like to develop my Javascript skills further.
